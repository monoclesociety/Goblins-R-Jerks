# NPCs
## Young Dragon
Young Dragons are more impulsive than their older kin.  Perhaps you meet a hatchling fresh from the egg, still incapable of language and more animal than sentient being.  Perhaps instead you come across a young wyrm on the rise, who has plans on how to establish a lair and horde.  Dragons can be adversaries or allies, so feel free to give this dragon their own goals and personality.  

# Enemies
## no one.
nada. zilch. zero.

# PlotTwists
## A Bribe Is Offered
The players are offered a bribe, whether in material wealth or their untold desires in order to stop or alter their current plans.  

# Locations
## Dragon's Lair
Whether in desert ruins, or mountain caves, dragon's lairs are full of traps and hazards as well as treasure.  Labyrinthine passages eventually lead to a grand chamber that holds the dragon's hoard, which often doubles as it's bed.  The chamber is often well decorated from the treasures the dragon holds.  Sometimes the dragon employs minions to help guard their lair. 

# Theme
## A Lost Treasure
A great treasure has been lost, and it is of significant importance to find it.  Whether this is because the wealth would be necessary to solve a problem, or the treasure has great power itself, the treasure must be found.  Unfortunately, it will take many clues to discern its location, and it is unlikely to be unguarded.
