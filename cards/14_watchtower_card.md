# Locations
## Wizard's Sanctuary
Full of arcane wards and sigils, this structure is incredibly dangerous to anyone who steps across its threshold.  Every Wizard's sanctuary is a bit different, with some preferring natural stone caverns, while others prefer extravagant towers or even giant monuments shaped like all manner of beasts.  Wizard's Sanctuaries contain all manner of wonders for those brave enough to plumb their secrets.

## Magic Has Gone Wild
Suddenly all magic has gone out of control.  Every enchantment and relic has been backfiring and malfunctioning, many seeming to take on a life of their own.  What does this mean for the players? How will they return magic to its normal level of unpredictability?
