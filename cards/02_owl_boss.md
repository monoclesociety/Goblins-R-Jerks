Diplomat's Guild Master Infiltrator

# Details
The Diplomat's Guild is headed up by a Master Infiltrator who is in charge of an enormous web of intrigue and politics.  Catching a Master Infiltrator sleeping is virtually possible as they are constantly on call to ensure relative peace.  Why does this one fight the players? Have they threatened goblin society? Has the Spymaster decided to sieze power for himself rather than maintain order?
