## Diplomat's Guildhall
The Diplomat's Guild does a lot of entertaining so its rooms are often draped in all the fineries goblins could find or make in the image of the surface world's extravagant palaces.  This often means the decor is more gaudy than elegant, but its still impressive.  Diplomat's Guildhalls are full of secret passages and nooks for spying on any who stay there.
