# Name
Goblin Firethinker

# Details
While goblins don't really mix with magic they occasionally have a talent that goblins call firethinking, though others call it pyrokinesis.  These goblins hide their abilities from authorities who inherently mistrust them, but some of the more clever ones manage to hone their abilities and exploit them to gain power.
