# Inventory

nada. zilch. zero.

# NPCs
## Tranquil Order Monk
The Tranquil Ones are silent and unsettling.  When they speak it is with a sibilant affectation that belies their reptilian nature beneath their robes and shrouds.  A Tranquil Order Monk will leave you alone unless you have been judged as impure and hurtful to the greater peace.

# Enemies
## no one.
nada. zilch. zero.

# PlotTwists
## A Promise Is Required
There is a person who has exactly what the characters need to progress, but before he will provide aid he demands an unusual promise.  Even if it sounds simple at first, the requirement should prove very inconvenient.

# Locations
## Tranquil One Monastery
Tranquil Ones live simple ascetic lives within monasteries.  Their lives are made up mostly of constant training and repetition.  They know very little in the way of excess and they are singleminded in the pursuit of their goals.  As such their monasteries contain little beyond a mess hall, bunks, an armory, and meditation rooms.

# Theme
## Allies Must Be Gathered
There was a time when the great kingdoms of The Underground would work together to extinguish any threat against them, but that time has passed.  Now a new threat has arisen and unless the players can help reforge old alliances, the entire world faces oblivion.
