## A Promise Is Required
There is a person who has exactly what the characters need to progress, but before he will provide aid he demands an unusual promise.  Even if it sounds simple at first, the requirement should prove very inconvenient.

# Locations
## Machinist's Guildhall
The guildhall of The Machinist's Guild is an extravagant structure seemingly made of gears and cogs.  A rhythmic ticking seems to fill the halls, resonating from the walls themselves.  Everything that can be automated with the hall is, and all manner of golems trail behind the guildmembers as they move from task to task. 

# Theme
