## Evidence of the Crown
Many goblins don't even know about The Goblin King since the guilds try to stamp out all evidence of his existence, but the players stumble on a kingly relic.  They could attempt to unravel its mystery but should also be aware that it is likely contraband to the guilds.

# Locations
## Hidden Palace
One of the Goblin King's former seats of power has been discovered.  It contains all of the finery you would expect from a human ruler, and bears very little resemblance to a goblin building.  It might be filled with valuable treasure, but could also be filled with forbidden contraband that the guilds disallow.

# Theme
## Unraveling The Network
An incredible conspiracy of lies has formed to prevent you from knowing some key piece of information. You will need to unravel the web of intrigue one layer at a time to get to the bottom of things.
