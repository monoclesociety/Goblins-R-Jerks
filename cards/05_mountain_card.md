# PlotTwists
## Overcome A Grudge
We all have those who bear a grudge against us.  In this scene the players come across someone with a grudge against at least one of them who also happens to have exactly what they need.  Overcoming a grudge can be challenging, but also quite rewarding.

# Locations
## Dwarven Hold
Dwarves have left the ruins of their temples, strongholds and vaults all throughout The Underground as a reminder of the greatness of their empire.  Though they have become less expansive over time, their ruins still stand.  Some serve as campsites for Dwarves who travel the cavernous subterranean roads while some now serve as homes for vicious monsters.

# Theme
## Broken Lineage
The bloodlines of kings often go back centuries, in the case of the Dwarf King it stretches back millenia. Whether goblin, dwarf, or some other type of being, a longstanding lineage is broken. A position remains vacant or under contention until the players step in to solve the problem.
