# PlotTwists
## A Fire Breaks Out
Everything is disrupted as a fire breaks out, causing everyone to stop and get to safety.  Who knows what the repercussions of the fire are, if valuables or evidence or even people are consumed, but it is certain that there will be lasting effects.

# Locations
## Guild Firehouse
The Firefighter's guildhouses are spread throughout goblin cities to ensure fast response times.  Goblins often live there for weeks at a time while on duty, so each Firehouse is equipped with bunks and a kitchen as well as storage for firefighting golems and all the various equipment the guild needs.

# Theme
## After The Fire
Where once a great settlement stood, now there is only ash.  While many dismiss it as a simple fire, it becomes apparent that something more burned away this bastion of civilization and left only pain and sorrow in its wake.  No matter their motive, the players must unravel the mystery of the fire and learn who caused such wanton devastation and more importantly why.
