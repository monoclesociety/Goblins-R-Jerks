# NPCs
## Ghoul Pack
A Pack of Ghouls can be extremely dangerous for a whole guild of goblins let alone a small group of them.  Ghouls have withered skin, sharp claws and hideous fangs that drip black saliva.  Their eyes are grey and full of cataracts though they can see and smell prey easily.

# Enemies
## no one.
nada. zilch. zero.

# PlotTwists
## The Dead Speak
The character's are visited with important information from beyond the grave, whether that's a dire warning or a warm affirmation.

# Locations
## Goblin Cemetary
The Goblins build elaborate cemetaries outside of their cities with rows of graves adorned with monuments, plus mausoleums for the more renowned goblins.  The headstones would appear nonsensical to a non-goblin with each carved image containing obscure symbolism that means nothing to surface dwellers.

# Theme
## Death Stops Working
While people begin decaying when they die, they continue to walk, talk, and speak. They attempt to live out their lives as though not dead, which sounds great at first, but quickly turns sour for their loved ones.
