## Undersea Pirates
Undersea Pirates are motley crews of goblins, dwarves, fungus-men and others.  They are usually exiles from their own societies or former abductees who grew to full blown crewmembers over time.  Undersea Pirates are often boisterous and exaggerative, spending time in the various watering holes of The Undersea's coastal settlements.

# Enemies
## no one.
nada. zilch. zero.

# PlotTwists
## A Sudden Attack!
The location where the players are felt safe a moment ago but that changed in an instant.  Whether its pirates, bandits, or monsters, the relative peace from a moment ago is gone.  How will the players survive? Will they make a stand or try to escape?

# Locations
## Pirate Cove
The craggy coast of The Undersea hides various pirate encampments in its nooks and crannies.  These encampments are crude and mostly temporary consisting largely of tents and a few wooden shacks erected as makeshift taverns.  Some of them are even built inside the mouths of coastal caves or hidden behind waterfalls.

# Theme
## Order Is Threatened
The order of society has been threatened.  Even goblin society has a chaotic sort of structure to it, but some new player threatens the system at its core.  Forces that are normally enemies will have to be made to work together if this threat is to be dispatched.
