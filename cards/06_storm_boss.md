# Name
Gremlin With A Grudge

# Details
While gremlins are not particularly strong or fast, they are determined and spiteful.  If scorned enough a gremlin could be empowered to gather information and power in order to disrupt the oppression they suffer under goblins.  This disruption is likely violent and sudden in nature as gremlins are not known for their discretion.
