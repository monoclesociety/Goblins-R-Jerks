# Details
Dwarves value accumulated wealth and family loyalty above all else.  They are known to hold grudges for the lifespan of a dragon if they are wronged.  These qualities make them a fierce enemy to have.  Dwarven nobles often try subversive methods to disrupt Goblin society so as not to risk open war, but if push comes to shove they will march into battle withou a second thought.
