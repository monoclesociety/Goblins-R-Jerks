# Name
Alchemist Guildmaster

# Details
Alchemist Guildmasters have an air of superiority and aloofness.  They maintain the exclusive standards of the Alchemist's Guild and look down on the other guilds with a bit of disdain.  Alchemist's create products for all of the other guild's so if one got ambitious and selfish enough it could cause a huge shake-up in goblin society.
