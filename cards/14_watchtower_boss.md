Archmage

# Details
Archmages are the most powerful of wizards, having traded in some measure of their humanity for their potent magical abilities.  If an Archmage lives below the surface it could mean they prefer privacy but it also might mean they practice the blackest of magic and want to hide it from their cohorts on the surface.
