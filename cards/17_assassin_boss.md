# Name
Butcher's Guildmaster

# Details
The masters of the Butcher's Guild like to battle alongside those they command, which unfortunately means they are short lived in their position.  With so much rotation through the position it is almost inevitable that a bloodthirsty tyrant will head up the guild every now and then.  The players can either hope their rule is short, or supplant them.
