# NPCs
## Scion of The Old Gods
Sometimes The Old Gods shed small pieces of themselves as though to create offspring. It is much easier to send these small creatures as harbingers and soldiers than it is for them to manifest wholly in our realm.  One of these such scions could pose a real threat to the players.

# Enemies
## no one.
nada. zilch. zero.

# PlotTwists
## Whispers In The Night
The players all experience the same dream or nightmare.  It is unlike their other dreams and they all remember it exactly the same.  The dream is full of surreal symbolism. Will they work to unravel their mysterious shared vision or dismiss it entirely?

# Locations
## Den of Cultists
In secret basement rooms or hidden caverns The Old Gods are worshipped.  There, in masks and robes, cultists chant strange prayers to their eldritch masters and grave sacrifices are committed.  No outsiders are allowed in such places and none are ever permitted to leave if they do make their way in.

# Theme
## Hold Steady
The players and their allies will come under a lengthy siege.They must use their wits and their blades to make a last stand against a powerful foe.  If they can send for help and make it until that help arrives, they will survive, but if not, they will perish under the might of their enemy.
